# Task Schedule - Trispr Flow

Last updated: 2026-03-13

## Overview

This file is the detailed execution log and block-level task table.
For current priorities and dependency ordering, use `ROADMAP.md` as source of truth.

Trispr Flow development uses an optimized **batched task schedule strategy** that reduces model switching overhead from 20+ to just **5 strategic model switches**. This approach groups tasks by AI model (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) to maximize efficiency and context reuse.

### Batched Schedule Strategy

Instead of context-switching between models for each task, tasks are organized into **blocks** where the same model handles multiple related tasks sequentially. This reduces:

- Context initialization overhead
- Model loading/unloading cycles
- Cognitive friction between task transitions
- Overall development time by ~30-40%

**Model Assignment Philosophy**:

- **Haiku**: Quick tasks, unit tests, simple refactoring, documentation fixes
- **Sonnet**: Feature development, complex UI work, integration tasks, testing
- **Opus**: Critical architecture decisions, deep refactoring, complex integrations, review/optimization

### Block J: Adaptive AI Refinement Intelligence --- PLANNED

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Model**: Claude Sonnet | **Status**: Planned (after Block E)

Two features that make the AI refinement pipeline more transparent and self-improving over time.

#### J1 — Hardware Requirements Indicator

When a user enables AI Fallback or selects a model, the UI should display VRAM requirements for the chosen model and warn if the GPU is likely insufficient.

**User-facing behaviour:**

- AI Fallback settings show estimated VRAM per model next to the model name (e.g., `qwen3:8b · ~5.9 GB VRAM`)
- If detected VRAM < model requirement → amber warning banner: *"This model may run on CPU (~1–5 tok/s, 30–120 s per chunk). Consider `qwen3:8b` for faster processing."*
- If no GPU detected → red warning: *"No GPU detected. AI refinement will use CPU and may be slow."*

**Implementation notes:**

- Tauri command `get_gpu_info` → Rust: try `nvml-wrapper` (NVIDIA), fall back to `wgpu` adapter query, fall back to `{ vram_mb: null }`.
- Model VRAM table embedded in frontend (static lookup by quantization tier from `list_ollama_models_with_size` output).
- Warning renders below the model selector in the AI Fallback settings panel.
- No Ollama API call required — size info already available from Block H's `fetch_ollama_models_with_size`.

| Task | Name | Complexity | Dependencies | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 43 | GPU VRAM detection (Tauri backend) | Medium | Block H | PLANNED | Rust command `get_gpu_info` returning `{vram_mb: Option<u64>, gpu_name: Option<String>}` via nvml-wrapper → wgpu fallback. |
| 43a | VRAM requirement display in AI Fallback UI | Low | Task 43 | PLANNED | Model selector shows size badge; warning banner renders when VRAM < model threshold. |

#### J2 — Adaptive Vocabulary (Self-Learning from AI Refinement)

When AI refinement consistently replaces the same word or phrase across multiple transcripts, the system should automatically propose (or auto-add) that substitution as a vocabulary rule — so Whisper learns the user's domain vocabulary over time.

**User-facing behaviour:**

- After a correction fires ≥ 3 times (configurable), the system auto-adds it to the custom vocabulary as a substitution rule: `original_word → corrected_word`.
- Optional: surface a *"Learned X new vocabulary rules this session"* toast after a session ends.
- Settings panel: toggle `Auto-learn vocabulary from AI refinement` (default: enabled). Sub-section shows learned rules with ability to accept/reject individually.

**Implementation notes:**

- Frontend (TypeScript): listen to `transcription:refined` events → compute word-level diff between `original` and `refined` (`diffWords` or a simple tokenised comparison).
- Maintain a `Map<string, Map<string, number>>` (`original → refined → count`) in session memory and persisted as `learned_vocabulary` in settings JSON.
- Threshold reached → call `update_settings` to append the rule to the existing vocabulary list.
- Learned rules are indistinguishable at runtime from manually entered ones — same pipeline, same Rust processing.
- Vocabulary rules are applied at Stage 1 (local rule processing), before AI fallback. The self-learning loop therefore improves the base transcript so the AI has less to fix over time.

| Task | Name | Complexity | Dependencies | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 44 | Word-diff extraction from refinement events | Medium | Block H | PLANNED | TypeScript: compare `original` vs `refined` payload from `transcription:refined`; extract word-level substitutions; accumulate in session map. |
| 44a | Persistence and threshold logic | Medium | Task 44 | PLANNED | Persist `learned_vocabulary` map to settings JSON. Auto-promote substitution → vocabulary rule after N occurrences (default 3). |
| 44b | Learned vocabulary settings UI | Medium | Task 44a | PLANNED | Settings sub-panel: toggle auto-learn, list of learned rules with accept/reject, session toast notification. |
| 44c | Adaptive vocabulary regression tests | Medium | Tasks 44, 44a | PLANNED | Unit tests: diff extraction correctness, threshold promotion, persistence round-trip, rule deduplication. |

### Block K: Expert Mode UX Overhaul --- PLANNED

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Model**: Claude Sonnet | **Depends on**: Block E | **Status**: Planned

A persistent toggle separates the app into two modes:

- **Standard mode** (default): Only essential settings visible — device, language, hotkeys, enable/disable toggles, AI Refinement tab (full).
- **Expert mode**: Reveals all timing/threshold/buffer controls (VAD thresholds, grace periods, chunk sizes, continuous dump parameters, overlay customization, chapters method, temperature/tokens/custom prompt in AI Refinement).

Implementation uses `data-expert-only` attributes on DOM elements — CSS hides them in standard mode, shows them in expert mode. No settings schema change needed; purely a display filter.

| Task | Name | Complexity | Dependencies | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K1 | Expert-mode toggle (header/settings, localStorage persistence) | Low | Block E | DONE | Toggle implemented in Settings tab, persisted via localStorage `trispr-expert-mode`, adds `expert-mode`/`standard-mode` root classes for follow-up K3. |
| K2 | Audit & classify all settings (agent-assisted) | Medium | Block E | PLANNED | Agent reviews every settings field; outputs two lists: standard vs expert. Decision document added to DECISIONS.md. |
| K3 | Apply `data-expert-only` attributes + CSS hide/show | Medium | K1, K2 | PLANNED | Add attribute to expert-only elements; CSS rule `.expert-mode [data-expert-only]` toggles visibility. |
| K4 | Settings re-ordering within panels (expert items sink to bottom) | Medium | K3 | PLANNED | Visual grouping: essential controls at top, expert controls below a subtle divider. |
| K5 | Regression tests (mode toggle shows correct subsets) | Low | K3, K4 | PLANNED | Unit tests verify standard mode hides expert elements; expert mode shows all. |

| O1 | `awaiting_confirmation` State im Workflow-Agent | High | M8, N6 | PLANNED | New backend state machine entry; pending action stored with TTL and unique token. |
| O2 | Activation-Word-Matching für confirm/cancel | Medium | O1 | PLANNED | Recognize "bestätigen" / "abbrechen" (+ EN synonyms) as confirmation tokens in `transcription:raw-result` handler. |
| O3 | `confirm_pending_action` / `cancel_pending_action` Commands | High | O1 | PLANNED | Tauri commands to resolve pending action; emit `agent:confirmed` / `agent:cancelled` events. |
| O4 | TTS Confirmation Prompt + Timeout | Medium | O1, N6 | PLANNED | Agent speaks confirmation request via TTS; auto-cancels pending action after configurable timeout. |
| O5 | KITT-Overlay: "Awaiting confirmation" Visual | Low | O4 | PLANNED | Overlay shows distinct "waiting" state while confirmation is pending. |
| O6 | Integration Tests für Confirmation Loop | High | O1–O5 | PLANNED | Unit + integration tests for state machine transitions, token matching, and timeout behavior. |

### Block P: Hands-Free Screen Interaction --- PLANNED

**Duration**: 4-5 weeks | **Model**: Claude Opus | **Depends on**: Block N (N5) + Block O (O3) | **Status**: Planned

Goal: Agent detects the active window, injects text into focused input fields via `enigo` (already in Cargo.toml), and confirms via TTS — fully keyboard-free workflow.

| Task | Name | Complexity | Dependencies | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | `enigo`-Command-Surface: `type_text`, `key_combo` | High | N5 | PLANNED | Expose `enigo::Enigo` as Tauri commands `inject_text` and `send_key_combo`. |
| P2 | Active Window Detection (WinAPI) | Medium | P1 | PLANNED | Detect foreground window title and class via WinAPI or `tauri-plugin-os`; return to agent as context. |
| P3 | Agent-Step-Type: `inject_text` in Execution Plan | High | P1, M5 | PLANNED | New step variant in `AgentExecutionPlan`; runner delegates to `inject_text` command. |
| P4 | Window-Switch + Focus: `focus_window_by_title` | Medium | P2 | PLANNED | Raise and focus a window by title match before text injection. |
| P5 | E2E Test: Voice → Screen-Insert | High | P1–P4 | PLANNED | Validate full path: voice command → agent plan → window focus → text inject → TTS confirmation. |

## Key Scheduling Principles

1. **Offline First**: Local refinement path is shipped before online provider integrations.
2. **Dependency Sequencing**: Tasks with dependencies are scheduled in blocks that can reference prior blocks.
3. **Complexity Distribution**: Backend provider work lands before UX and E2E stabilization.
4. **Team Efficiency**: Planning/architecture first, then contained execution packets with low drift.
5. **Risk Mitigation**: End-to-end tests are scheduled at block end to catch integration failures early.

---

## How to Use This Schedule

1. **Per Block**: Assign block to the designated model
2. **Model Context**: Load the block description + task list + relevant code files
3. **Task Execution**: Work through tasks in order, maintaining model focus
4. **Transition**: When block completes, switch to next block (and next model if different)
5. **Checkpoints**: Run integration tests at block boundaries to verify correctness

---

## Notes for Developers

- **Task Dependencies**: Explicitly track in task table. Block order respects critical path
- **Estimation**: Task complexity (Low/Medium/High) guides effort expectations
- **Flexibility**: If a task reveals unexpected complexity, add sub-tasks or escalate to higher model
- **Documentation**: Each block's final task should include documentation updates
- **Testing**: Integration tests should validate cumulative task outputs, not just individual task correctness
- **Context Loading**: Read ARCHITECTURE.md, DECISIONS.md, and V0.5.0_PLAN.md before starting any block

---

## Version Release Criteria

Each version is considered **release-ready** when:

- All tasks in final block completed
- End-to-end integration test passes
- Code reviewed and merged to main
- Changelog updated
- Release notes drafted

See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) for full project timeline.
