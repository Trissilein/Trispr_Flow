# Roadmap (Sketch)

This is a compact view of the roadmap. The detailed version is in the repo root: `ROADMAP.md`.

## Now
- Documentation sync across roadmap and architecture/state docs

## Next
- Activity feedback: tray pulse and transcribe backlog warning/expansion

## Then
- Capture enhancements: activation words, language pinning, extra hotkeys

## Later
- Post-processing pipeline and AI fallback overhaul
- Long-form transcription features (export, chapters, topics)
- Conversation window configurability
