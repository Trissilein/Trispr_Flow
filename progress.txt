# Trispr Flow — Current Progress

**Last updated**: 2026-02-08

## ✅ Completed

### Core Platform
- Frontend modularized into focused TypeScript modules.
- Backend modularized (`audio`, `transcription`, `models`, `state`, `paths`).
- Security hardening implemented (URL safety, checksum verification, download limits).
- Unit + smoke baseline established (`npm run test`, `npm run test:smoke`).
- Model manager refined (single list, active-first sorting, 2-column grid).
- Model downloads fixed for DE turbo; delete vs remove semantics for internal/external models.

### Capture & Transcription UX
- Input/Output capture flows are available with dedicated panels.
- Recording/transcribing activity indicators split and visible in app UI.
- Transcribe defaults to disabled on app start (session-only enablement).

### Overlay & Tray
- Dot and KITT overlay styles are both supported.
- Overlay style switching and runtime behavior have been stabilized.
- Tray menu sync exists for mic/transcribe toggles.
- Overlay now has dedicated tray runtime toggle requirement documented (full on/off behavior).

### Model Optimization
- Quantizer (quantize.exe from whisper.cpp) integrated for model compression to q5_0 format (~30% size reduction).
- Optimize button added to Model Manager for user-initiated quantization.
- Model descriptions for all q5_0 variants (large-v3-turbo, large-v3, distil-large-v3, german-turbo).
- Quantizer bundled in NSIS installer; build-quantize.bat script for manual builds.
- Hero model display expanded to 2 lines for longer quantized model names.

## 🔄 In Progress

### Documentation Sprint
- Sync and clean roadmap/docs after recent overlay and state-flow changes.
- Align wording between status and decisions across all project docs.
- Consolidate working notes into stable documentation files.

## 📋 Next Up

1. Finalize documentation updates (`ROADMAP.md`, `.claude/ROADMAP.md`, architecture/state docs).
2. Milestone 3 Activity Feedback follow-up:
   - tray pulse cadence
   - backlog warning + expansion flow
3. Capture Enhancements (activation words, language pinning, extra hotkeys).
4. Post-Processing pipeline (rule-based + optional LLM refinement).
5. Long-form features (dump, chapter segmentation, topic detection).

## 🧩 Known Follow-up Constraints
- `npm run build` currently fails on pre-existing TypeScript issues in:
  - `src/settings.ts` (`transcribeStatus` ref)
  - `src/ui-state.ts` (`output_device` typing)
- These are tracked as separate frontend cleanup tasks.
